# Playfair cipher implementation with GUI
Implementation of Playfair Cipher in Python with GUI.

This implementation is capable of using two different languages for generating the cipher matrix - English (replaces "J" with "I") and Czech (replaces "Q" with "O").

The ciphertext returned after encryption holds any digits and spaces from the plaintext through the usage of string representation of these characters. They also converted back during decryption.
